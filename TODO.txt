 * Better error reporting, now too techie
 * Cosmetic improvements to help (try to tab everyting in one level)
 * Improve the yaml parsing library to trim the strings, now it crashes if there is a space at the end of the config item
 * FIXME in scripts.go
 * Make sure that all the config items are correctly propagated (timeout is now ignored)
